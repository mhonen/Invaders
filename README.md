<h1>Invaders</h1>
<h3>My first attempt to make a game in Godot 4</h3>
<p>This game is my first attempt to create a space shooter.  For now it is bearbones and only has an initial player with movement.  I hope to eventually finish the game and submit it on itch.io.  This will be a long
process in my attempt to better my love and hobby: Game Development.</p>

<h2> Version: 0.1</h2>
<h3> Date: 9/23/2023</h3>
<h4> Added files:  Space sprite assets and created player level and player script: player.gd</h4>
<p>The initial setup was just to get the player to move horizontally.  This is also the time that all of the assets needed were imported into the game engine.</p>
